# Introduction

This will allow the user to play 5 games of rock, paper and scissors against the computer, wihtin the console.

## Skills Demonstrated

During this project I had the chance to demonstrate my knowledge of if else statements, for loops, along with functions and functions that call other functions.

### Updated

I have recently added a very basic UI. Allowing the player to use a button to select their option. It will also announce a winner after 5 wins. THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED.
